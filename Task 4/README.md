I applied aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG on numeric columns to perform basic data analysis on the Company table.

Then, I used the GROUP BY clause to categorize data â€” for example, grouping by name or occupation.

Finally, I used the HAVING clause to filter grouped results, specifically showing only those records where the age is less than 27.
