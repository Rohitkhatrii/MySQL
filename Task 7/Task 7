1.Use CREATE VIEW with complex SELECT

#Use CREATE VIEW with complex SELECT

CREATE VIEW CustomerOrderSummary AS
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.name,
  c.address,
  COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
  SUM(o.amount) AS total_amount
FROM
  Customers c
JOIN
  Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
  c.customer_id, c.name, c.address;

2.Use views for abstraction and security

# Use views for abstraction and security
# abstraction means to access 
# For security we are using granting of Access 

Create 
SQL SECURITY INVOKER 
View Public_Information
AS Select id,name,occupation
from Company;

# We create a user first then we can grant access
CREATE USER 'rohitkhatri'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'rohitkhatri';

# Granting access
GRANT SELECT ON rohit1.Public_Information TO 'rohitkhatri'@'localhost';

# To show grants
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rohitkhatri'@'localhost';

# TO remove the privleges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON rohit1.* FROM 'rohitkhatri'@'localhost';
